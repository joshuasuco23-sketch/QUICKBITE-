# F-E_MANAGE_CART_ITEMS (React Native)

**How to run (local)**

1. Install Expo CLI (if you don't have it): `npm install -g expo-cli`
2. In this folder run:
   ```
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
3. Make sure backend is running and accessible. Default `API_BASE` in `App.js` is `http://10.0.2.2:4000` for Android emulator. Replace with your backend host/IP or use Expo tunnel.
